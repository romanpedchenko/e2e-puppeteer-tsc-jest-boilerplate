# Boilerplate for E2E testing using Puppeteer + TypeScript + Jest

## Description

* [Puppeteer](https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer) is a Node library which provides a high-level API to control Chrome or Chromium over the DevTools Protocol. Puppeteer runs headless by default, but can be configured to run full (non-headless) Chrome or Chromium.

* [Jest](https://jestjs.io/en/) is a delightful JavaScript Testing Framework with a focus on simplicity.

* [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) is Typed JavaScript at Any Scale.

## Installation

```bash
$ npm install
```

Copy .env.config to .env

## Running the tests

```bash
$ npm run test or npm test
```
